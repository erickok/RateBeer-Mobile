	<p>
	  RateBeer Mobile for Android is now released under the GPL. We have chosen to do this as interest in helping with development increased and to hopefully leverage the knowledge and experience developing Android apps that we know is out there.

      <div class="news-text">
	<p>
	  We are experiencing issues with sending beermail, we are working to fix the issue and that is holding back the release of 1.5.0 as the only remaining issue.
	</p>
	<p>
	  It seems this might be an issue with the way we are working with ratebeer.

	<p>
	  For the first time I have added a beta version to the site.
	</p>
	<p>
	  This is a bugfix release only, but there is a lot of internal changes done, so it needs testing.

      <div class="news-text">
	<p>
	  I just uploaded a brand new version of RateBeer Mobile on the Android Market. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  This new release contains two major new features:<br />
	  - Support for scanning barcodes when doing searches<br />
	  - Support for a Location Aware list of Beer places. It will display a list of nearby (within 15mi) beer places.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Both these features should be considered beta features so please report any bugs you may encounter.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The barcode scanning feature is very much dependent on the barcodes available in the database and so far only a very small amount of beers are currently in the database. A later version will add support for adding barcodes to the database.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Enjoy and Happy New Year!!

	  As the ratebeer.com site has changed we now have a couple of bugs in Ratebeer Mobile for Android using beermail. I'm working on fixing those bugs as well as releasing the friends feed feature. Stay tuned, I'm working as fast as I can!

	  Although RateBeer Mobile has not seen any updates in a while its because I've been busy creating a test suite to give the application a thorough testing.
	</p>
	<p>
	  I've had almost no bug reports so its hard to fix "Force Close" issues as people report on the Market. To fix these bugs I will need more valid bug reports including: Device, Android Version, Which screen, What was the user trying to do and so on. As long as I don't get any valid bug reports I won't fix any bugs unless I happen to stumble upon them myself. Hence the test suite. Hopefully the test suite will help me find bugs as well as provide a way to easily test the application when new versions of Android is unleashed.
	</p>
	<p>
	  I've also been working on a small new feature... So stay tuned.

	  The Chancelog for the RateBeer Mobile application has now been added to the site. Only future changes will be tracked on that page.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The way to report bugs has been changed to emailing android@moerks.dk. The bugs will then be manually tracked on the Bugs page. This is a temporary solution until a proper solution can be found. Anyone know of a good project/issue tracking site with bazaar or Git support that allows closed source programs?
